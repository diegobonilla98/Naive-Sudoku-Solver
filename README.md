# Naive-Sudoku-Solver
Just a fun idea, not the best, but is mine.


Nothing really to say, just a personal 5 minute project that works fine. Solves sudokus by checking all posible numbers just like a human does when solving one.
Not necessary optimized or bullet-proof but solves any Sudoku in under 10 milliseconds.

## How does it work?
Just try it! I think the code speaks for itself (for any further questions do it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-bonilla-salvador/) :D) just clone it and run:
```shell
python main.py
```
